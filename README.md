This is a very simple command-line tool, and Python module to manage the
backup files of various note-taking applications. It's currently missing a lot
of core features, since it's still in the early stages of development.

The intent of this project is to provide an easy way to convert backups between
applications, export them to Markdown, and synchronise them to a cloud.

Currently the project only provides Markdown conversion for the Android 
application [Quillpad](https://github.com/quillpad/quillpad). Features such as
backup conversion, and cloud synchronisation will likely come soon.
